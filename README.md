# Text_to_Speech_Converter
This project is a simple web-based Text to Speech Converter that allows users to enter text, select a language, and convert the text into speech. It uses Flask as the backend framework and the gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) library to generate audio files. Users can then download the audio output for their use.
